----- MTP-Manager preAlpha experimental release source codes -----
   This is a GNU/GPL application and has no WARRANTY. 

-Why is this program developed?
   The main reason is to make Linux user able to use their music players 
with all features. I am planning to implement playlist manager, music 
tags editor and album artworks receiver. One other reason is to have a 
bugless managing. However the official managers may have many bugs. But
at least we can avoid from common security problems.

-Installation
This application depends on libmtp, taglib and Qt libraries.

-Usage
Click refresh icon to list connected devices. Currently you are able to
browse files in device and send files by dropping them into files list.
